These are due primarily to a dearth of resources dedicated towards health solutions as well as a lack of awareness of basic health knowledge. In Pakistan, 1 in 89 women die due to pregnancy or childbirth-related complications.  Similarly, almost 7 infants out of 100 die before they reach one year of age.  Almost 40 percent of children in Pakistan are malnourished.  Preventable conditions such as malaria, diarrhea, bronchial infections, and gastrointestinal infections abound. Health indicators suggest that it is the lack of accessible healthcare — not terrorism, drones or the energy crisis — that is the greatest adversity facing Pakistan.  Pakistan spends a shockingly low percentage of its GDP (2.6 percent) on healthcare.  The poor quality of government-provided health services in Pakistan is the major reason behind the large role played by the private sector in healthcare.",

PuR is a small sachet produced by P&G which purifies polluted water by eliminating harmful elements from it.  Within the first year HOPE launched this campaign (from 2009 to 2010) we distributed 1.2 million sachets of PuR.  During the 2022 Pakistan Flood Crisis, 21 million liters of PuR were distributed in flood-ravaged communities.

Constructing a hand pump therefore serves as a much-needed proactive healthcare measure for underserved communities. HOPE has approximately 140 hand pumps scattered throughout various poor localities and villages in Pakistan such as: Ghagger, Gharo, Khatore, Tharpakar, Sakhro, Badin, Karachi (Link Road), Muzaffargarh, Thatta, and Azad Kashmir, just to name a few.  Each hand pump provides a steady supply of clean water for 50 to 75 families (400 to 800 people). Hand pumps are constructed on a first-come first-serve basis.  It can take anywhere from eight to ten months from the time you place your initial order to the time we can update you with pictures of your completed hand pump.

Due to the massive displacement of families, women and children were hit especially hard and malnourishment was rampant among survivors. HOPE deployed a medical team to Swat and Dir to administer relief aid to the Internationally Displaced Persons in the region.  This diverse team of medical professionals and social workers treated 1,000 patients during their work in the area. In June 2007, the coasts of Sindh and Balochistan were ravaged by hurricanes and floods.  The waters left roads and transport lines unusable,  making relief efforts almost impossible. In a collaborative effort, HOPE, Indus Motors, HSBC Bank, and House of Habib set up relief operations in Gadap, Dadu, Juhi and Kharo Chand, all regions which were heavily affected by the storms. On October 29, 2008 Balochistan was rocked by a 6.4 earthquake; the areas of Ziarat and Pishin district were worst hit.  Over 200 people perished in the disaster and thousands more were left displaced and homeless with winter on its way.

Growth stunting due to malnourishment/undernourishment affects as many as 50% of Pakistan's children. 40% of children under the age of 5 in Pakistan are stunted according to the UN World Food Program, and of those, 11% are severely malnourished. Similarly, 20% of the general population faces hunger on a daily basis.",
      para2:
        "HOPE is aiming to tackle poverty from all angles: Healthcare, Education, Vocational Training, Clean Water, and Disaster Relief. We believe that citizens can break free from the cycle of poverty through adequate intervention. By tackling the crisis of food insecurity at a grassroots level, we are reducing malnourishment in the general population, and especially children, which will then lead to better health outcomes for the most vulnerable fragments of society in Pakistan. HOPE USA is attempting to tackle the problem of food insecurity in Pakistan head-on by delivering monthly food rations to families living below the poverty line in Pakistan. Our Food Rations is one of our most cherished donor-initiated projects and was inspired by a supporter's concern for our beneficiaries living well below the poverty line in Pakistan.  For this ongoing project, we hand deliver a month's supply of food rations to as many families as we are able to help them fulfill their basic needs for nutrition.  This movement began as a humble gesture and has only amplified in reach, especially during times of high demand such as the Covid pandemic and the 2022 Pakistan Flood Crisis. Our Food Rations consist of a month's supply of Rice, Wheat Flour (to make tortillas), Lentils, Cooking Oil, Milk Powder, Tea, Sugar, Salt, and Biscuits - enough for a family of 8. In addition to distributing Food Rations, during various occasions throughout the year, our team reaches out to underserved communities by sharing cooked food (such as biryani, a South Asian rice and chicken dish).  Cooked food is distributed during times of emergency aid, school functions, and sometimes just to bring some joy to underserved areas. During Ramadan, our distribution of both Food Rations and Door-to-Door Iftars increases, and we also commemorate communities coming together to enjoy a meal while they break fast.  Usually our functions are held on school campuses and we are humbled that many corporate supporters and organizations have stepped up to sponsor these events.  In addition to providing a nutritious meal, community iftars are a perfect way to help create and nurture bonds between students, community mentors, and human beings. The Islamic holiday of Eid ul Adha provides us with an opportunity to distribute meat to underserved communities, all while commemorating the occasion.  For the vast majority of our beneficiaries, Eid ul Adha is the only time of year they are fortunate enough to enjoy meat, and we encourage our supporters to share Qurbani amongst the poor in underdeveloped neighborhoods throughout Pakistan.",

        "HOPE USA has been sponsoring Ramadan iftars in its formal schools in Pakistan (in Zia Colony: 610 students, Muzaffargarh: 320 students, and Thatta: 340 students) for the past ten years.  Iftar is the meal that Muslims eat at sundown after a day of fasting.  Providing dinner for one child costs $3 and as a donor you can sponsor an entire school or a group of children. A silver lining of the Covid-19 pandemic was that it ushered in a new tradition of delivering hot meals to those in need. The 11,000 students who attend HOPE's formal and home schools in Pakistan come from backgrounds of extreme poverty.  They are used to sacrificing even the basics such as a meal, clean water, and proper housing.  We have made it a tradition to gift them with new outfits every Eid. HOPE distributes monthly food rations year-round and especially during Ramadan.  Each family is provided with necessities such as rice, flour, lentils, and dry foods. HOPE uses general donation (Sadaqa) funds towards health and educational activities that improve the community as a whole such as hospital beds, hospital equipment, surgical equipment, neonatal incubators, desks for students, and teaching supplies.",
